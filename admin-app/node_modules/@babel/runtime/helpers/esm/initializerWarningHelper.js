In this version, we first check if we're in production mode by checking the value of `process.env.NODE_ENV`. If we're not in production mode, we proceed to check if the `transform-class-properties` plugin is enabled by inspecting the `context.options.plugins` array. If the plugin is not enabled, we throw a more informative error message.

If we're in production mode or the plugin is enabled, we can add any additional logic or implementation needed. In this case, I've left it blank for you to fill in as needed.
